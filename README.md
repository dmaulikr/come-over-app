### development requirements

1. Android Studio [Link](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
1. React Native [Link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
1. XCode (Optional, since I focus on Android for now.)

1. `react-native run-android` - After you run an Android simulator or connected to an Android device, you can simple use this command to test run your App.
